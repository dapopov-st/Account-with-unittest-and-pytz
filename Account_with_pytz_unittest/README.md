A simple Account class with timezones handled by pytz and return_timezone helper function. 
Confirmation numbers are produced after every transaction and user information is validated.
Unittest is used to test the methods in the Account class. To run the tests, navigate to the current directory at the command line, then type
python -m unittest test_account.py
The code was written to project specifications found in the .ipynb file.  I wrote the tests after studying Fred Baptiste's approach.
