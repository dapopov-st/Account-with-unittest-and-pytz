A simple Account class with timezones handled by pytz and return_timezone helper function. 
<br/>Confirmation numbers are produced after every transaction and user information is validated.
<br/>Unittest is used to test the methods in the Account class. To run the tests, navigate to the current directory at the command line, then type
```bash
python -m unittest test_account.py
```
<br/>Except for the use of pytz to handle time zones, the code was written to project specifications found in the .ipynb file.  
<br/> Many thanks to Fred [Baptiste](https://www.udemy.com/user/fredbaptiste/) for problem definition and teaching many of the necessary techniques
